# Overview

I recently worked on a C++ project with the goal of demonstrating my understanding of the language's syntax. The software I developed is an interactive text-based adventure game, showcasing various C++ features such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and the use of the Standard Template Library (STL) with vectors.

My primary purpose in creating this software was to enhance my skills as a software engineer by applying and deepening my understanding of C++. The project allowed me to explore and implement different language features while building an engaging narrative-driven application.

# Future Work

As I reflect on this project, I've identified areas for future improvement and expansion:

- Enhanced Storyline: Expand and refine the narrative to create a more immersive and compelling story.
- Graphics and UI: Integrate graphical elements and improve the user interface for a more visually appealing experience.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to enhance the software's resilience in handling unexpected input.
